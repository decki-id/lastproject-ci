							This was my thesis project back in college, developed between November 2019 - February 2020.
							As indicated by the logo, the project was built using the CodeIgniter 3 PHP framework,
							along with Bootstrap CSS framework, a pinch of JavaScript, and MySQL as the DBMS.<br>
							It was also my first project to feature an email verification and notification system.
						</p>
						<hr class="w-25">
						<p class="card-text text-justify">
							I decided to create Helpdesk Ticketing System because at the time, I was already working as
							an IT Support Specialist, and the work environment was still quite conventional — ticketing
							was done via email and/or WhatsApp, and daily activities were recorded using Notepad and
							saved locally as text files. However, after the thesis defense was completed, the system
							was never used. To this day, the division still doesn't use any ticketing portal, as
							customers have grown accustomed to submitting tickets via WhatsApp.
						</p>
						<hr class="w-25">
						<p class="card-text text-justify">
							Besides the email verification and notification features, the system primarily handles
							ticket submissions and updates, agent listings, customer companies and their respective
							points of contact, as well as simple reports.<br>
							Please sign up using a real email address so the system can perform the email verification
							and send notifications properly.
